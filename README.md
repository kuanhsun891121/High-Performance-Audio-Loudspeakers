## üî© Design Considerations
- **Input Filtering:** Decoupling capacitors eliminate DC components
- **Preamp Stage:** Transistor amplifier boosts MIC signal (based on CE amplifier)
- **Gain Control:** Adjustable via variable resistor (VR1)
- **Power Stabilization:** Electrolytic capacitors filter voltage ripple
- **Speaker Output:** Requires additional filtering capacitors to prevent DC output
